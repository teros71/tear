TODO:

Add handling of recursive shape lists:
- how is appearance applied
- how are shapes spread
- maybe add count for shape lists and a cumulative count also?
- maybe mark a shapelist to be a leaf = no recursive applying?
- parametrize tear algorithm to mark what is the leaf?
- make colour ranges work within a list of colours
- spreading according to path: open or closed paths
